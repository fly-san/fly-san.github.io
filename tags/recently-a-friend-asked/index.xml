Hm what&amp;rsquo;s the psychological explanation behind sitting on the floor being so calming
For one, the ease of access to information and communication has transformed human life in ways no one could have predicted or imagined even just a century ago. Global real time communication means we are constantly being fed information every second of our lives, from everywhere, often at the same time.

As opposed to a chair, you need to make a conscious decision to actually sit down on the floor, but when you embrace it you might find some comfort.</description></item></channel></rss>
