&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He wanted you to know he never suspected you.
He wanted you to know he always trusted you completely.
Always loved you and trusted you. He said he would have sooner mistrusted himself.
And he had but one regret: that he never made you his duchess.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; Paul Atreides, from Dune, Book One, Frank Herbert&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description></item><item><title>Love everything regardless</title><link>https://blog.flysan.xyz/quotes/misc/i-love-you/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.flysan.xyz/quotes/misc/i-love-you/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Your life is not bound by labels, nor is it bound by expectation. You simply are. It is only when we rid ourselves of labels we&amp;rsquo;ve been given since we were born, that we can begin to truly be. When we begin to treat what&amp;rsquo;s around us with love, we can find it in our hearts to love ourselves as well. What you have gone through, the pain you have felt, does not go to waste. Love them regardless. Love everything regardless.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Videos that live rent free in my mind</title><link>https://blog.flysan.xyz/misc/videos/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.flysan.xyz/misc/videos/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Here is a compilation of videos which always put a smile, or tears, on my face, and maybe on yours too!
They may be memes, playlists, songs or just nice videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alpha&lt;/strong&gt; by C418 is one of the nicest videogame OST pieces out there, and together with the &lt;strong&gt;End Poem&lt;/strong&gt;
by Julian Gough makes up my favorite artistic compositions of all time. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in the story behind the poem, &lt;a href="https://theeggandtherock.substack.com/p/i-wrote-a-story-for-a-friend"&gt;&amp;ldquo;I wrote a story for a friend&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; talks about it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
