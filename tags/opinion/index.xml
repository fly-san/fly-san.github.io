Hm what&amp;rsquo;s the psychological explanation behind sitting on the floor being so calming
I don&amp;rsquo;t think there&amp;rsquo;s necessarily a single explanation for that, but my first guess was that it had to do with the fact floors are generally cold, uncomfy and dirty. As opposed to a chair, you need to make a conscious decision to actually sit down on the floor, but when you embrace it you might find some comfort.</description></item></channel></rss>
