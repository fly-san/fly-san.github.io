&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He wanted you to know he never suspected you.
He wanted you to know he always trusted you completely.
Always loved you and trusted you. He said he would have sooner mistrusted himself.
And he had but one regret: that he never made you his duchess.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; Paul Atreides, from Dune, Book One, Frank Herbert&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description></item><item><title>Love everything regardless</title><link>https://blog.flysan.xyz/quotes/misc/i-love-you/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.flysan.xyz/quotes/misc/i-love-you/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Your life is not bound by labels, nor is it bound by expectation. You simply are. It is only when we rid ourselves of labels we&amp;rsquo;ve been given since we were born, that we can begin to truly be. When we begin to treat what&amp;rsquo;s around us with love, we can find it in our hearts to love ourselves as well. What you have gone through, the pain you have felt, does not go to waste. Love them regardless. Love everything regardless.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Short quotes</title><link>https://blog.flysan.xyz/quotes/misc/shorts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.flysan.xyz/quotes/misc/shorts/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;These quotes were too short, or could not be attributed to a single author, to warrant a single post, so I have compiled them here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The beginning of life is also the start of death&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Life isn&amp;rsquo;t as hard as you think it is, but it&amp;rsquo;s not as easy as people say it is&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Circunda-te de rosas, ama, bebe e cala.&lt;/p&gt;
