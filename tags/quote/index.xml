You simply are. It is only when we rid ourselves of labels we&amp;rsquo;ve been given since we were born, that we can begin to truly be.

&amp;ldquo;Circunda-te de rosas, ama, bebe e cala.
O mais Ã© nada.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Fernando Pessoa
We shall not cease from exploration And the end of all our exploring Will be to arrive where we started And know the place for the first time.</description></item></channel></rss>
