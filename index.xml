&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can I be so low-energy when I&amp;rsquo;ve done almost nothing productive for the last week?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one, the ease of access to information and communication has transformed human life in ways no one could have predicted or imagined even just a century ago. Global real time communication means we are constantly being fed information every second of our lives, from everywhere, often at the same time. If the first industrial revolution had brought anonymity to society, the third and fourth have brought exposure: we have the ability to literally summon knowledge from all over the world, at the palm of our hands, in a matter of seconds, all the while watching your favorite netflix series. Not 50 years ago and to research even a simple thing it would literally take hours, but now, we can find essentially any piece of freely available information by just typing it into a black box.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Sitting on the floor</title><link>https://blog.flysan.xyz/blog/sitting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Feb 2023 21:13:53 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.flysan.xyz/blog/sitting/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recently a friend asked:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hm what&amp;rsquo;s the psychological explanation behind sitting on the floor being so calming&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think there&amp;rsquo;s necessarily a single explanation for that, but my first guess was that it had to do with the fact floors are generally cold, uncomfy and dirty. As opposed to a chair, you need to make a conscious decision to actually sit down on the floor, but when you embrace it you might find some comfort.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>fly</title><link>https://blog.flysan.xyz/blog/fly/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Feb 2023 21:20:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.flysan.xyz/blog/fly/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m fly, and this is my blog!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;üê±‚Äçüêâ I like challenging things (sometimes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;üê±‚Äçüíª I study Computer Science @TUM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;üê±‚Äçüë§ I&amp;rsquo;m learning Python, Lua, Java, Javascript, C, OCaml, x86 ASM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;üê±‚Äçüèç I love problem solving and programming - but most importantly: I love cats!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound like me, you&amp;rsquo;re probably have the wrong person!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Dune</title><link>https://blog.flysan.xyz/quotes/books/dune/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.flysan.xyz/quotes/books/dune/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He wanted you to know he never suspected you.
He wanted you to know he always trusted you completely.
Always loved you and trusted you. He said he would have sooner mistrusted himself.
And he had but one regret: that he never made you his duchess.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Your life is not bound by labels, nor is it bound by expectation. You simply are. It is only when we rid ourselves of labels we&amp;rsquo;ve been given since we were born, that we can begin to truly be. When we begin to treat what&amp;rsquo;s around us with love, we can find it in our hearts to love ourselves as well. What you have gone through, the pain you have felt, does not go to waste. Love them regardless. Love everything regardless.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Short quotes</title><link>https://blog.flysan.xyz/quotes/misc/shorts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.flysan.xyz/quotes/misc/shorts/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;These quotes were too short, or could not be attributed to a single author, to warrant a single post, so I have compiled them here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The beginning of life is also the start of death&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Life isn&amp;rsquo;t as hard as you think it is, but it&amp;rsquo;s not as easy as people say it is&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Circunda-te de rosas, ama, bebe e cala.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O mais √© nada.&amp;rdquo;

They may be memes, playlists, songs or just nice videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alpha&lt;/strong&gt; by C418 is one of the nicest videogame OST pieces out there, and together with the &lt;strong&gt;End Poem&lt;/strong&gt;
by Julian Gough makes up my favorite artistic compositions of all time. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in the story behind the poem, &lt;a href="https://theeggandtherock.substack.com/p/i-wrote-a-story-for-a-friend"&gt;&amp;ldquo;I wrote a story for a friend&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; talks about it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
