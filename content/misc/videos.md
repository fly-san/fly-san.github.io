Here is a compilation of videos which always put a smile, or tears, on my face, and maybe on yours too! 
They may be memes, playlists, songs or just nice videos.

**Alpha** by C418 is one of the nicest videogame OST pieces out there, and together with the **End Poem** 
by Julian Gough makes up my favorite artistic compositions of all time. If you're interested in the story behind the poem, ["I wrote a story for a friend"](https://theeggandtherock.substack.com/p/i-wrote-a-story-for-a-friend) talks about it.

Very well made amateur official music video for Wild Side, and the behind-the-scenes is also worth a watch.

**RADWIMPS** is one of my favorite bands and "あいたい" is simply a beautiful song, which makes me teary everytime. It was released in commemoration of the 10th anniversary of the 2011 Great Tohoku Earthquake. 

> As I listened to these songs again while I was creating this album, I was reflecting over these years: “what kind of life have I lived since that day?”  “What have I done to deserve the life I fortunately lived over the past decade?” I keep asking myself these unanswerable questions. And I will continue to live in limbo struggling to find an answer that seems plausible but only fleetingly.
