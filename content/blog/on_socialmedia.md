> Hm what's the psychological explanation behind sitting on the floor being so calming


For one, the ease of access to information and communication has transformed human life in ways no one could have predicted or imagined even just a century ago. Global real time communication means we are constantly being fed information every second of our lives, from everywhere, often at the same time. If the first industrial revolution had brought anonymity to society, the third and fourth have brought exposure: we have the ability to literally summon knowledge from all over the world, at the palm of our hands, in a matter of seconds, all the while watching your favorite netflix series. Not 50 years ago and to research even a simple thing it would literally take hours, but now, we can find essentially any piece of freely available information by just typing it into a black box. 

And what's worse, we use most of this computational power simply to access figments of the completely fragmented and/or fictional narratives of literal strangers. This is all getting worse as, for example, infinite scrolling and short-format content takes over the internet; in less than 10 minutes, your brain is exposed to all sorts of different things, from memes to family guy clips to educational videos to talk shows to stand-up comedy. And that's the very reason this format is so popular: it's addictive, it distracts you, it takes your mind away from whatever you've been worried about. We get hooked on it because our brains weren't made for all this exposure at the same time.

Even if you don't directly use social media, you're surrounded by a society who does: by people who do, and these people, by more people. Being social beings, information easily carries over, and with it, expectations, norms, rules, fears. 

All this overstimulation has your brain constantly running at 100 km/h, and when we take the foot off the gas pedal, all this energy has nowhere to go, and the momentum that's left makes you feel like you're never doing enough: you're falling behind. You have a mismatch between the energy you can output on your own and the energy your brain is used to. And, no matter how fast you try to run, you will never be able to catch up. You develop a necessity to be doing something "useful", something "productive", and god forbid if you feel too tired to do it - what have you even done all week, after all...? 

Of course, that's not the entire story right? You have been productive, even if it's on the deceivingly simple task of being alive. You have done things - it's just that your silly monkey brain thinks it needs to be going as fast as possible to be worth something, but that's not true. You can take it slow, you deserve to, and you need to. There are things more important than being useful, and your friends, family and yourself are some of them. :)
