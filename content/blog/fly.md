Hi, I'm fly, and this is my blog!

- 🐱‍🐉 I like challenging things (sometimes)
- 🐱‍💻 I study Computer Science @TUM
- 🐱‍👤 I'm learning Python, Lua, Java, Javascript, C, OCaml, x86 ASM
- 🐱‍🏍 I love problem solving and programming - but most importantly: I love cats!

If that doesn't sound like me, you're probably have the wrong person!
