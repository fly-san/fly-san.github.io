### Question:

> Hm what's the psychological explanation behind sitting on the floor being so calming

### Take:

I don't think there's necessarily a single explanation for that, but my first guess was that it had to do with the fact floors are generally cold, uncomfy and dirty. As opposed to a chair, you need to make a conscious decision to actually sit down on the floor, but when you embrace it you might find some comfort.

But after thinking more about it, I actually would say it has more to do with how it changes the perspective you have from the world. Usually we see, hear and feel things from the same angles: from above or at least more or less the same height. Whether you're standing, walking, talking to someone, or even when sitting down, we usually experience things from familiar perspectives.

However, when you're sitting or laying on the floor that's the lowest you can physically go, while being in the same environment, and so to perceive or interact with other things/people you need to look up. And I think this necessity to look up is quite humbling and may somewhat evoke a feeling of sublime, even if you're not consciously thinking about it.

I guess the feeling is similar to, if you allow yourself to imagine, you're sitting on a chair in a classroom looking up to your teacher who is right next to you. Although there's an implied subordination relationship, the very fact there's an actual physical vertical distance and the need for you to look up is very belittling.

To sum it up, I don't think sitting on a floor is inherently calming, but somewhat dependent on the environment you're in. in the same way that if a teacher was screaming at you for not doing your homework, I doubt you'd feel calm if you were sitting down in the middle of a huge crowd of people all standing around you.

(this is a very obvious conclusion, but it was fun to think about that)
