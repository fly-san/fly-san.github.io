> "Your life is not bound by labels, nor is it bound by expectation. You simply are. It is only when we rid ourselves of labels we've been given since we were born, that we can begin to truly be. When we begin to treat what's around us with love, we can find it in our hearts to love ourselves as well.  What you have gone through, the pain you have felt, does not go to waste. Love them regardless. Love everything regardless."
